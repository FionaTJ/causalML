To test if X is conditional independence of Y given Z, the test looks in the data for a statistically significant amount of statistical association between X and Y for different values of Z. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, we conclude independence.\n",

Thus, the number of p-values that fall above or below the threshold will depend on the size of the data. The size of the data has nothing to do with ground truth causality. As an exercise, vary the variable N. As N increases, you should see that The number of tests that return True increases with N.\n",
